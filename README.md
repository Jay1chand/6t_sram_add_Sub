# 6T SRAM Cell with Add/Sub Logic Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains the **Cadence Virtuoso simulation of a 6-transistor (6T) SRAM cell** integrated with **basic arithmetic operations** (addition and subtraction). The project demonstrates how memory cells can interact with simple combinational logic to perform operations directly on stored data.

## Features
- Standard **6T SRAM cell** simulation.
- Integrated **add and subtract logic**.
- Verified functionality through **Cadence Virtuoso simulations**.
- Includes **waveforms and transient analysis** for read/write and arithmetic operations.


## Tools Required
- **Cadence Virtuoso** (schematic editor and simulator)
- **Spectre** or **ADE L** for transient simulations
- Optional: waveform viewer (included in Virtuoso)
